        as the primary protein, a reflection of the bird's availability and popularity. The dish gained widespread
        popularity in the United States during the 19th and 20th centuries, becoming a staple of American comfort
        cuisine. Today, chicken pot pie continues to be a cherished dish known for tis heartwarming combination of
        flaky pastry and creamy, savory filling, making it a timeless classic enjoyed in households across the world.
